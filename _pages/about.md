I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in [Dr. Shan Luo](https://shanluo.github.io/)’s Lab at the Department of Engineering, King’s College London (KCL). My research interests include **reinforcement learning**, **learning from demonstration(LfD)**, **robot manipulation planning and control**, and **robot perception**, with a specific focus on deformable objects.

Recently, I am working on a ViTac: Visual-Tactile Synergy for Handling Flexible Materials project funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) to develop a new Visuo-Tactile integration mechanism for handling flexible materials, e.g., cloth and rope. I am also responsible for assisting a few UG and PGT students with their final-year projects.

I received my Ph.D. degree in Mechanical Engineering at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University in 2022, under the guidance of [Dr. Henry K. Chu](https://henrychulab.github.io/) and [Prof. Li Cheng](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/researchgrp/chengli/). I was granted funding to visit [Prof. Yi Guo](https://personal.stevens.edu/~yguo1/)’s lab at the Stevens Institute of Technology, USA, from 2020 to 2022.
