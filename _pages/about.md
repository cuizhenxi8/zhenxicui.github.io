I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in [Dr. Shan Luo](https://shanluo.github.io/)’s Lab at the Department of Engineering, King’s College London (KCL). My research interests include **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)**, **Learning from Demonstration(LfD)**, **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**, and **Robot Manipulation Planning and Control**, with a specific focus on deformable objects.

I  contributed to the EPSRC-funded project 'ViTac: Visual-Tactile Synergy for Handling Flexible Materials,' focusing on the development of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to enhance robot policies in handling materials like cloth and rope. Furthermore, I provided guidance and supervision to three undergraduate (UG) and one postgraduate (PGT) students in their final-year projects.

I received my Ph.D. degree in Mechanical Engineering at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University in 2022, under the guidance of [Dr. Henry K. Chu](https://henrychulab.github.io/) and [Prof. Li Cheng](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/researchgrp/chengli/). I was granted funding to visit [Prof. Yi Guo](https://personal.stevens.edu/~yguo1/)’s lab at the Stevens Institute of Technology, USA, from 2020 to 2022.
