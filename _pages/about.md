I am a robotics researcher and currently a **Lecturer in Electronic and Robotics Engineering** at the **University of West London (UWL)**. My work focuses on integrating advanced machine learning techniques with robotics to address challenges in dynamic and unstructured environments, with applications in manufacturing, human-robot collaboration, and beyond.

As a Postdoctoral Fellow in **Dr. Shan Luo's lab** in the Department of Engineering at King’s College London (KCL), I contributed to the EPSRC-funded project **“ViTac: Visual-Tactile Synergy for Handling Flexible Materials.”** My research centered on developing reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to enhance robotic manipulation of deformable objects, such as cloth and rope.

I earned my **Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering** from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University in 2022 under the mentorship of **Dr. Henry K. Chu** and **Prof. Li Cheng.** My doctoral work specialized in robotic manipulation of deformable objects, addressing key challenges in perception, planning, and control. During my Ph.D., I received funding to visit **Prof. Yi Guo’s lab** at the Stevens Institute of Technology, USA (2020–2022), where I collaborated on robotics projects involving perception and control.
