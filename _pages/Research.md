The aim of our research group is to develop robots that can interact with the physical world safely and robustly. We leverage high-resolution tactile sensing, visual understanding of objects in the scenes and robot learning to enable the robots to have such desirable capabilities.

### **Optimization based deformable object manipulation** 

--|--
![sss](/images/IROS2.gif)| Automated Folding of a Deformable Thin Object through Robot Manipulators. <br /> By using the Levenbergâ€“Marquardt algorithm, the task of folding a deformable thin object can be reformulated as a convex optimization problem.


<!-- ### **Acquiring depth information in a distorted environment**
